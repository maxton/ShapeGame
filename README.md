#Shape Game

##What is Shape Game?
The Shape Game was a project I worked on in 2012/13 for my AP Computer Science class. It is not an exceptional example of my ability as a programmer and I have come a long way since writing this.

##Why are you releasing it to the public domain?
I see no reason to withold such petty code from the globe. If people want to see how I was programming 2+ years ago, so be it.

##Can I Play the Game?
It may be difficult unless you compile it yourself. You can try playing it at http://cs.max-ton.net/, although Java 8's new draconian security settings may make it difficult. Try adding an exception for my domain.
